FIRST TIME RUNNING THE CODE

Setting folder paths

- You will need to set the folder path to the GitHub repository clone manually:
	- In your R console, run getwd() and note the returned folder. E.g. "C:/Users/vpi201/OneDrive - University of Exeter/Documents"
	- Navigate to that folder and there create a .txt file named "bioadd-wp2-paths.txt"
	- On the first line of bioadd-wp2-paths.txt, enter the folder path of your local clone of the project GitHub repository, e.g. "C:/GitHub/bioadd-wp2-github/" (omit the quotation marks)
    - On the second line, enter the path to the project Dropbox folder, e.g. "C:/Users/ville/Dropbox/Work Packages/WP2/"
	- The slashes must be forward slashes: /
	- Make sure that the folder exists
- The script setup.R, which you will run in the beginning of every session, will check that you have correctly specified the folder
- setup.R will create the remaining folder structure within the project folder:
    - data
    - output such as tables and figures
    - a folder for local R scripts: /r/local/
