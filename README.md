# BIOADD Work Package 2

This repository hosts all code for BIOADD Work Package 2. It is currently a private repository, only shared with the researchers involved in the BIOADD project, but it can evolve into a public repository once our work is published.

### How does this work?

It is strongly recommended to install [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com) if you're not familiar with using the command line. This way, you can use a GUI to exploit GitHub's features.

After installing GitHub Desktop, go to the [GitHub WP2 Repo](https://github.com/el-chinosauro/bioadd-wp2-github), click on "Code" and on "Open in GitHub Desktop", as shown in the picture below:

### GitHub practices

Initially, we will store our data on the shared WP2 Dropbox folder. 

### Data Management

Please refer to the [BIOADD data webpage](https://el-chinosauro.github.io/bioadd-wp2-github/) for data management best practices.
