# BIOADD Work Package 2

This repository hosts all code for BIOADD Work Package 2. It is currently a private repository, only shared with the researchers involved in the BIOADD project, but it can evolve into a public repository once our work is published.

### How does this work?

It is strongly recommended to install [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com). 

### GitHub practices

Initially, we will store our data on the shared WP2 Dropbox folder.
