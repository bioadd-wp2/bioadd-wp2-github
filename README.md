# BIOADD Work Package 2

This repository hosts all code for BIOADD Work Package 2. It is currently a private repository, only shared with the researchers involved in the BIOADD project, but it can evolve into a public repository once our work is published.

Please refer to the [BIOADD data webpage](https://bioadd-wp2.github.io/bioadd-wp2-github/) for a guide on how to use GitHub for this project and data management best practices.
